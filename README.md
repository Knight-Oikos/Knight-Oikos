## About

I am a professional Mining Engineer-in-Training, currently a Short Range Planner at U.S. Steel Corporation. I hold a Bachelors of Applied Science in Mining Engineering, as well as a minor in Data Science from the University of British Columbia. I've acquired close to 3 years of engineering-related work experience in surface and underground operations and have done a research term in mineral processing under the supervision of Dr. Bern Klein and his PhD candidate (at the time) Giovanni Pamparana.
